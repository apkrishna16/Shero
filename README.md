Our team, "No Way Home," has focused our project on addressing SDG-1 (No Poverty) and SDG-5 (Gender Equality). Unemployment is a prevalent issue globally, particularly impacting women. To tackle this, we've developed a user-friendly website aimed at helping women find job opportunities and gain independence. We understand the challenges women face in the job market and strive to make the process easier by providing a platform that aggregates relevant job openings and scholarships. Many organizations, both governmental and private, offer scholarships for women, yet awareness of these opportunities is often lacking. Our website aims to bridge this gap by providing easy access to information on available scholarships once users provide their details. Through our platform, women can explore and apply for relevant opportunities, empowering them towards financial stability and personal growth.
